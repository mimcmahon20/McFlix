## Bugs and Next Steps

- **Movie Description Underflow:** Currently, there is an issue with movie descriptions not displaying properly for movies that extend beyond the initial page. This can lead to a less than optimal user experience, particularly on mobile devices. Consider improving the layout to ensure consistent readability across all dimensions.

- **Top 10 Row:** Implement a dedicated "Top 10" row that showcases the most popular or highest-rated content. This feature can provide users with quick access to trending titles.

- **Clickable Redirect Elements:** Enhance the user experience by implementing functionality for clicking on movies or other elements to redirect users to more detailed information pages or trailers.

- **Optimize GSAP Animations:** While GSAP animations are used successfully in the carousel, further optimization and fine-tuning can be done to ensure smooth performance across different devices and browsers.

Feel free to contribute to this project by addressing these issues and adding new features to enhance the user experience.
